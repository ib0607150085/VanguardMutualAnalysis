# VanguardMutualAnalysis

In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of five Vanguard mutual fund indexes over a period of five years using R. The objective was to understand stock trends and derive actionable insights for better investment decisions.

### Key Activities:

- **Data Analysis**: Leveraged R to analyze mutual fund data, focusing on trends and patterns over the five-year span.
- **Collaboration**: Worked closely with colleagues to identify and examine key statistical indicators crucial for mutual fund analysis.
- **Portfolio Construction**: Based on the statistical indicators observed, we constructed tangent and efficient portfolios, aiming to maximize returns while minimizing risk.

### Project Goals:

The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of mutual fund trends, enabling investors to make informed decisions. By using statistical analysis, we aim to enhance the understanding of mutual fund performance and optimize investment strategies for better financial outcomes.

This README file serves as a detailed overview of the project, outlining the methodologies used and the insights gained. We hope this analysis contributes to more effective investment strategies and improved portfolio management.
